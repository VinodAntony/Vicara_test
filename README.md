# Vicara_test

## 1. Initial Dataset and Training:

-> The data is generated randomly using numpy, math and the random modules.

-> The generated data along with the output target classes are passed to an estimator (Gaussian Naieve Bayes in this case) provided by the scikit-learn module.  

-> The trainer provides us with 5 parameters which are required for the next step
	- Theta
	- Sigma
	- Prior
	- Epsilon
	Values are noted and are to be used for the CMSIS-DSP library in the next step
